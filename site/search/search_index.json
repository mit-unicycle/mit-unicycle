Through this complete documentation, we will guide you through the manufacturing and software installation process of the robot. We will also provide you with a detailed description of the software architecture and the different components of the robot, empowering you to further develop the prototype and add new features to it. Project Description Our practical requirements focus on stabilizing a robot holding itself on a pole or an actuated wheel to the ground, having 2 axis of freedom. The requirements include the following: stabilizing the robot along one first axis, then a second perpendicular axis and therefore apply real-time corrections on the linear combinations of the torque along both axis, allowing the whole to self-balance on the pole or the wheel. Physics Background How are we going to produce the necessary force required to stabilize the robot? The answer is by using reaction wheels. A reaction wheel is a type of flywheel used primarily by spacecraft for attitude control without using fuel for rockets or other reaction devices. They are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star. Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see torque). This is compared to the maneuvering thrusters used on many spacecraft, which can also translate the spacecraft, and are therefore located at various places on the spacecraft. Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may require a change in the angular momentum vector of the spacecraft, and the wheels' rotation rate will change in response. To reactivate zero rotation speed, the wheel is accelerated in the direction opposite to its rotation. The momentum of the wheel opposes the momentum of the spacecraft, slowing the spacecraft. To rotate the spacecraft in a given direction, the wheel is accelerated in that direction. This causes the spacecraft to rotate in the opposite direction, according to Newton's third law. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the rotation of the spacecraft will accelerate, whether or not the wheel is subsequently slowed back down to its nominal speed. To desaturate the reaction wheel, the direction of rotation of the reaction wheel is reversed for a short time. This transfers angular momentum from the spacecraft to the reaction wheel to slow the rotation of the spacecraft.

This section will be separated in 3 parts : the first presenting the parts that can be used for both one and two axis, then the parts specific to the one axis design and finally the parts for the two axis model. For the designs we used Fusion 360 and Prusa 3D printers . Note that every dimension reported on the blueprint are given in millimeters (mm) . Common parts 1.1 The reaction wheel and the spacers 1.2 The teethed pulley 1.3 The motor coupler 1.4 The motor pulley First prototype 2.1 Main platform 2.2 Motor shaft holder 2.3 Reaction wheel holder 1. Common parts 1.1 The reaction wheel and the spacers The reaction wheel In order to achieve the maximum moment of inertia for the reaction wheel, our objective was to maximize the diameter of the wheel. Since the moment of inertia is the sum of the squared distances to the mass, the farther the mass is from the axis, the larger the moment will be. However, we faced a constraint due to the size of the printing bed of the printer we used for the distance to the axis. Our experimentation demonstrated that a wheel with a thin design could easily break if the model were to fall. This is why the model we have implemented here is highly robust and should not break, provided it is used correctly in the application of this project. Note that the reaction wheel has 32 holes for the screws used to add weight far from the axis. The most crucial aspect of printing this part is to use an appropriate perimeter setting. Increasing the perimeter setting enables us to reinforce the piece without significantly increasing the infill. It is essential for the holes where we will insert screws, nuts, and the location where the ball bearing will be placed to be sufficiently strong. This ensures that they do not break during rotation or when inserting the ball bearing. Here we used a perimeter of 4 and an infill of : The spacers As you can observe in the section explaining the assembly of the model, we needed spacers with the same inner diameter as the ball bearing to ensure a good fit between the ball bearings. The accompanying design picture, illustrates the dimensions of one of these spacers. Please note that we used spacers of various sizes, but we are presenting only one blueprint as the only difference lies in the height of the spacers. //todo add the list of size of the spacer we use The plates spacers : In order to avoid that the belt hits the nuts from the reaction wheel while working, we needed spacer plates to increase the distance between the teethed pulley therefore we designed the spacing plates here bellow is the design and the dimensions of those spacers. 1.2. The teethed pulley We used GT-2 belts, which necessitated the design of GT-2 pulleys. To achieve this, we employed a functionality in Fusion 360 that enabled us to create parametric designs of the pulleys. This approach facilitated the rapid design of the desired pulley variations and also facilitated testing different gear reduction options. The creation of this design is explained step by steps just bellow The GT-2 pulley follows a specific standard for the teeth, which includes the pitch of the teeth on the pulleys and belts. Therefore, the parametric design of the pulley size depend on the desired number of teeth . In our specific application, the number of teeth required is determined by the desired gear reduction. //todo : add parameter list with the explanation of what they correspond to for pulley //todo : explain parameters explain step by step the creation of the parametric design For this particular printing, the most important setting to consider is the precision . Given that we are printing pulleys with small teeth, it is essential for the printing to be as accurate and precise as possible. Here we used the option : 10mm Quality preset from Prusa Slicer . To prevent the belt to skip, we need plates to help the belt stay straight in on the pulley, here's the blueprint of those plates : 1.3. Motor coupler For the motor coupler, we machined them using the tools available to us. This approach enabled us to create a high-quality coupler specifically designed for the motor we had. We were unable to find any suitable couplers for purchase online that could be delivered within a reasonable time frame, which is why we resorted to machining our own. Here's the blueprint we created for this coupler 1.4. The motor pulley : 4. First prototype : 1. Support plate : As the first prototype purpose is to balance in one axis of freedom, we needed a plate where we could fit the motor, the ESC, the breadboard and the esp8266.
