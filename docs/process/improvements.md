# Future Improvements

In the end, due to a lack of time, we did not manage to make the 2 Axes Model balance. Many challenges arose when finally tuning that model. However, we strongly believe that with more time, we could have gotten a very well-working model. 

These are the following improvements we wish we could have done to this model: 

1. Since the robot has now more freedom to move around, the turning wheels are exerting a torque around the feet that hold the model and thus it starts spinning. As such, we could implement another feature to the controller to counteract the spinning. 

2. It is very difficult to understand what effect on the balancing each wheel is having. Hence, we think that a quick-swap mechanism that allows us to mount the robot to a testing bench, constraining one axis to tune it separately, would help enormously. 

3. The feet it stands on, made out of a combination of hard filament and flexible filament, is too soft. This makes the balancing harder. In order to solve this, we could design a better, stronger and wider feet that is able to take the whole weight of the robot.
