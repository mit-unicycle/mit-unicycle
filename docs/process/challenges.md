# Challenges Faced

Throughout the eight weeks of working in these project, we faced many challenges and difficulties. In this part of the documentation, we will address these challenges and discuss the solutions we found. The goal is to document the process and provide a small troubleshooting guide. 

## Obtaining a Stable and Precise Angles from the MPU605

## Using the Implementation Incorrectly 

## Maximizing the Torque From the Motor

## Dynamically Shifting the Setpoint

## Collaboration

For many of us, this was the first time working on such a big project and with so many team members. As such, collaboration was a a significant challenge right from the beginning.
