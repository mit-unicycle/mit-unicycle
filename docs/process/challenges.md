# Challenges Faced

Throughout the eight weeks of working in these project, we faced many challenges and difficulties. In this part of the documentation, we will address these challenges and discuss the solutions we found. The goal is to document the process and provide a small troubleshooting guide. 

## Obtaining a Stable and Precise Angles from the MPU605

## Using the Implementation Incorrectly 

## Maximizing the Torque From the Motor

## Dynamically Shifting the Setpoint

## Collaboration

For many of us, this was the first time working on such a big project and with so many team members. As such, collaboration was a a significant challenge right from the beginning. All of the team members were really motivated and invested in the project. Hence, when there were different opinions about how to do something, it was often hard to reconcile the different viewpoints. Often, when the opinions differed, they led to significant internal discussions. A notable example is what motors we should use. Some of us believed that a brushed would be the best option, while others believed that a brushless one would be more adequate. In the end, we often solved such conflicts by testing both options and finding which would be "objectively" the best. 

It is interesting to reflect back on this project, since a considerable part of the difficulty was not conceiving the robot in itself, but the collaboration. This is why, not only did we acquire more knowledge, practical and technical skills, but we also learned to collaborate. We found out that collaboration is a mix between stating what you as individual wants to do, while keeping in mind what others want to do, and finally discussing a solution that suits both parties. It is for this reason that we are happy to have embarked on such a project, since we strongly believe it will help us in our future professional and personal lives.
