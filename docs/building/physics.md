# Underlying Physics

In order to build a functioning balancing robot, it is really important to understand the physics that make it work. In this section, we will address this.

The self-balancing capability of our robot relies on the fundamental principles of angular momentum and torque. A reaction wheel, connected to the motor through a system of pulleys and a toothed belt, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the robot. When the robot tilts, the reaction wheel resists this motion due to its angular momentum. As a result, a reactive torque is generated that counteracts the tilting motion. By exerting an opposing force, the reaction wheel helps restore the robot to an upright position. This continuous adjustment and counteraction of tilting forces enable the robot to maintain its balance in real time.
