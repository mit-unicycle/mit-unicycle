# Assembly Instructions

In this page you'll find the information about the building of the first and second prototype, you'll need to have the following elements with you :

**For the one axis prototype :**    
 
 * 1x The main plate for one axis 
 * 1x the motor mount
 * 1 meter M8 rods
 * M3 screws
 * M3 nuts
 * 1x Motor pulley
 * 1x Motor coupler
 * 1x GT2 7 times reductions with plates
 * 3x ball bearings 




### **Instruction to build the first prototype :**

Here's a small gif that shows help you to visualize how is assembled the first prototype :

On this gif there is not nuts or screws, therefore we'll explain here where you should put them.

first you'll need four M3 screws, nuts and washers to fix the motor mount to the plate. 

To securely fasten the motor coupler with the motor pulley, you will need to use M3 screws and nuts. Similarly, for the assembly of the big pulley, pulley plate, spacer plates, and reaction wheel, you can use M3 screws and nuts to join them together.


To securely tighten the long threaded rods, you will require four M8 nuts and washers. These will be used to fasten the two long threaded rods with the main platform, with one set of four nut and washer placed on the top face and the other set on the bottom. Similarly, you will need another set of four M8 nuts and washers to align and secure the motor shaft holder with the pulley and ball bearing, following the same concept as with the main plate. Additionally, four M8 nuts and washers will be used to fix the motor wheel holder in place.

You should also use nuts to tension the ball bearing. For each ball bearing, you should have a nut placed against it to apply tension.

To enhance the friction of the model, it is recommended to glue rubber bands onto the bottom surface. This will increase the grip and traction, providing better stability and reducing slippage. You can also choose how many M3 screws you want on the reaction wheel, keeping in mind that the more you put, the bigger the moment of inertia will be.
